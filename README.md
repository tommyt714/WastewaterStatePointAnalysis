# WastewaterStatePointAnalysis
This program comprises a calculator that incorporates wastewater treatment theory into an analytical solution for ideal sludge recycling rates in an activated sludge process and also depicts the solutions graphically.  This code could potentially be used as the basis for an automated rate adjustment based on input parameters.
